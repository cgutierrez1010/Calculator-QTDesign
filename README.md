For my project I chose to design my own calculator,  the calculator is a culmination of a comprehensive effort to design 
and implement a custom calculator using Qt Design Studio and C++. It was my first time using QT Design Studio and I thoroughly 
enjoyed how cool it was and was surprised by how somewhat simple it was.
